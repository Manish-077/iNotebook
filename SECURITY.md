# üõ°Ô∏è Security Policy

## üîê Security Features

This application implements multiple layers of security to protect user data and prevent common vulnerabilities:

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Token Authentication**: Secure, stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds (10) for secure password storage
- **Protected Routes**: All sensitive endpoints require valid authentication
- **Token Expiration**: Automatic token validation and renewal handling

### Data Protection
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation using express-validator
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: MongoDB's BSON format prevents SQL injection
- **XSS Protection**: Input sanitization to prevent cross-site scripting
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin request handling

### Environment Security
- **Environment Variables**: All sensitive data stored in environment variables
- **Secret Management**: Secure JWT secrets with high entropy
- **Database Security**: MongoDB Atlas with encrypted connections
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All credentials externalized from source code

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** open a public issue
2. Email the details to: [your-email@example.com]
3. Include steps to reproduce the vulnerability
4. Allow time for investigation and resolution

## üîß Security Best Practices for Deployment

### Environment Variables
Never commit `.env` files to version control. Always use:
- Platform-specific environment variable settings
- Secure secret management services
- Encrypted environment variable storage

### Database Security
- Use MongoDB Atlas with network access restrictions
- Enable MongoDB authentication
- Use connection strings with SSL/TLS
- Regularly rotate database passwords

### Server Security
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use security headers (helmet.js recommended)
- Monitor for suspicious activities

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] All `.env` files are in `.gitignore`
- [ ] JWT secrets are randomly generated (64+ characters)
- [ ] Database credentials are secure
- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] Input validation is implemented
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Dependencies are updated and scanned for vulnerabilities

### Production Environment
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled
- [ ] Security headers are configured
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented
- [ ] Logging and monitoring are set up
- [ ] Database access is restricted
- [ ] Regular security updates are scheduled

## üîç Security Scanning

### Recommended Tools
- `npm audit` - Check for vulnerable dependencies
- `snyk` - Advanced vulnerability scanning
- `eslint-plugin-security` - Static code analysis
- `helmet` - Security headers middleware

### Regular Maintenance
- Update dependencies regularly
- Monitor security advisories
- Perform periodic security reviews
- Test authentication and authorization flows

## üìã Compliance

This application follows security best practices including:
- OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
- Node.js security best practices
- MongoDB security recommendations
- JWT security standards

## üÜò Emergency Response

In case of a security incident:
1. Immediately revoke compromised credentials
2. Rotate JWT secrets
3. Check logs for suspicious activities
4. Notify affected users if necessary
5. Implement additional security measures
6. Conduct post-incident analysis

**Remember**: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. Regularly review and update security measures.
